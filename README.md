# Projects
C++ implementation of classical AI search algorithms (A*, UCS, IDS) with a modular node-based architecture for pathfinding and state-space exploration.

# AI Search Algorithms in C++

This project implements classical Artificial Intelligence search algorithms in C++, focusing on pathfinding and state-space exploration.

## Implemented Algorithms

- A* (A-Star Search)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

The system is built around a modular `Node` abstraction, enabling clean state representation and extensibility across different search strategies.

## Features

- Object-oriented design
- Separation of algorithm logic and state representation
- Comparative implementation of informed and uninformed search
- Cost-based and heuristic-based evaluation

## Technologies

- C++
- STL (priority_queue, vectors, etc.)
- Classical graph/search theory concepts

This project demonstrates algorithmic thinking, performance-oriented implementation, and understanding of fundamental AI search strategies.
